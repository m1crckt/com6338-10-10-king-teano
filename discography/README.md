# Notes
    - Created basic HTML structure
    -

# Attribution
    - Display "Music data provided by Spotify" on every page showing spotify content (footer or near content)
    - Use the official Spotify logo only when referencing the platform
    - Do not alter, recolor, or modify the logo
    - Example:
        <footer>
            <p>Music data provided by Spotify</p>
        </footer>

# Branding
    - Do not use "Spotify" in the project's name (e.g., avoid names like "Spotify Throwback Player")
    - Do not imply official partnership or endorsement with Spotify
    - Make sure our site's design is visually disctinct from Spotify's branding

# Data Usage
    - Use Spotify data as-is (no renaming, cropping, or editing album art)
    - do not permanently store or cache Spotify data longer than allowed (max 24 hours)
    - Do not store or share personal user data if we implement Spotify login (not planned for this project)

# Display Guidelines
    - Show track title, artist name, and album art together to avoid confusion
    - If using Spotify's embedded player, do not obscure or modify it
    - Clearly indicate Spotify as the data source on any page that uses it

# General Restrictions
    - Project is for educational purposees only, not monetized
    - No selling, licensing, or redistributing Spotify data
    - Remove Spotify API keys from public repos if required
